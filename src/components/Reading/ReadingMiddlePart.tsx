            <p>The global transition to renewable energy sources has accelerated dramatically over the past decade. Solar and wind power, once considered expensive alternatives to fossil fuels, have become the cheapest sources of electricity in most parts of the world. This remarkable transformation has been driven by technological advances, government policies, and changing economic conditions.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has experienced the most dramatic cost reductions. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the cost of solar PV has fallen by 89% since 2010. Wind power costs have also declined significantly, dropping by 70% over the same period. These cost reductions have made renewable energy competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources without subsidies in many markets.
